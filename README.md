Another project for a Course, more complex than the other one.

I received the images and a photoshop document (format .psd) and had to replicate what I saw. This one I found much harder to replicate and had to start over. Thankfully I was much faster because of the experience acquired and also because I could reuse the code.

This page has a searchbar, a self made calendary and much more elements that change when you are hovering with the mouse or using them.
It doesn't look as cool as ExotiCar but it's much harder to make, in my opinion.

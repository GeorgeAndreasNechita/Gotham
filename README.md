Another project for a Course on Web Development i'm making on Udemy. It's more complex

I received the images and a photoshop document (format .psd) and had to replicate what I saw. This one I found much harder to replicate and had to start over and peroperly use Flexbox in CSS. Thankfully I was much faster because of the experience acquired and also because I could reuse the code.

This page has a searchbar, a self made calendary and much more elements that change when you are hovering with the mouse or using them.
